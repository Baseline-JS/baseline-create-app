## Installation

Instructions on how to install and set up your project.

Node.js v20 (v20 or higher) & npm@10.5.0 or higher [(we suggest installing and using nvm)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script) follow instructions in the link to install, you will generally need to create a new terminal session after installing. If you already have nvm update it before proceeding.

- If nvm is installed you can switch versions with `nvm install 20 && nvm use 20 && nvm alias default 20 && nvm install-latest-npm`
- If not using nvm you can manually install node and npm, download from <https://nodejs.org/en/download/> alternatively use the operating system package manager or any other appropriate tool to install node
